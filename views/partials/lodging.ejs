          Support Roger's employer and stay at an Airbnb! Airbnb is a great alternative to traditional hotels, and can be an inexpensive option for staying in Seattle during high season. If you're unfamiliar with how Airbnb works, feel free to <a href="mailto:rogerntan@gmail.com">email Roger</a> who would be more than happy to help.
